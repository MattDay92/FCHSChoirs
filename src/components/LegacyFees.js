                        <p>**Note: In order to maintain the financial health of the FCHS choirs, students and families must be fully responsible for their participation fees.  If any student is not making an attempt to pay fees, the CBO and the directors reserve the right to remove students from competitions, withhold costumes, and seek assistance from collections services.</p>

                        <p className='offcanvas-last'>These dates detail important payment deadlines.  It is suggested that payments be made on a monthly basis so that no one will fall behind. Please communicate if you have a special concern or request and arrangements will be made if possible.  Communication is key!  Financial aid is available for those that have a need.  Please talk with Sarah Bullington  to get information. All May- July fees need to be paid online at FCHSchoirs.com. Payments may also be brought in and deposited in the choir room’s payment box once school begins.  Cash payments made during the school year are highly discouraged but will be accepted; however, no receipt will be given.  Any requests for paper bills must be made to the Treasurer. P.O. Box and choir room payment box and safe  will be checked once a week. Students that withdraw from participation for any reason will still be responsible for covering their portion of the costs for the entirety of the year.  (the FULL amount of $275 if before the start of second Semester, $425 if after the start of second Semester.</p>
